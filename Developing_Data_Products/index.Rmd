## Motivation

1. Learn more about the Random Forest Algorithm while doing the 'shiny' class project.
2. Use this idea to create a product whereby tuned Random Forest models for various data sets are preloaded, end users can then enter their own data too obtain predictions.

## My Heart Disease Data Set

```{r interactive, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
WD <- c("C:/Users/20537710/Documents/Coursera/Data Products/Project/Random Forest Demonstration")
setwd(WD)
#require(rCharts)
hddata <- data.table(read.csv("heartdiseasedata.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ","))
setnames(hddata, c("age","sex","cp","trestbps","chol","fbs","restecg","thalach","exang",
                   "oldpeak","slope","ca","thal","heartdisease") )

hist(hddata$heartdisease)
```
